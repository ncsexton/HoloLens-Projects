# Unity Scripts
Scripts from an experiment using the unity game engine to gather data on the HoloLens, as the entire project was too large to upload to GitHub.

The scripts manage the XYZ coordinates of an in-game coffee mug, with the HoloLens acting as a client, constantly sending the updating location of the mug to the server.
As it sends these coordinates, the round-trip time is recorded for data collection purposes.
